% since comment is based on verbatim, this only works

% respective lines
%
% the accompanying |gsexam.el| file is sufficient to inform AUC\-\TeX
% (the emacs mode for editing \LaTeX) about the need to indent
% |\begin{answer}| and |\end{answer}| specially.  It can be loaded
% directly, or will be dealt with automatically if installed in a
% directory mentioned in the emacs variable |TeX-style-path|.  (If
% editing a file from scratch, typing |C-c C-n| or selecting the
% |Reset Buffer| menu option from the |LaTeX| menu after the buffer
% contents contain the directive to load this class should be
% sufficient to load the relevant customizations).
